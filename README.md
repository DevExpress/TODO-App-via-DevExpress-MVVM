# A sample application powered by DevExpress WinForms MVVM.

This sample illustrates a sample WinForms application built with DevExpress MVVM Framework. The app contains the following modules:

* A welcome screen
* Main application form that shows other application modules (screens) as pages inside its NavigationFrame control
* The "Items" screen that shows a check-list of to-do items
* The "Edit item" screen that allows users to edit individual to-do items

This sample demonstrates a number of concepts used in DevExpress MVVM Framework:

* Property and data bindings
* Command bindings
* Services
* Messenger

The **"MVVM Best Practices"** demo provides a module that provides a step-by-step description on how this sample module was created.
